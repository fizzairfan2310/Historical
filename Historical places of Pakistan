                 Perhaps one of the most famous landmarks of Pakistan, the Lahore Fort is a piece of history most have heard of.
                 The well-known fortress was entirely rebuilt in the 17th century, though it’s believed to have been inhabited in some way for millennia.
                 Some of the most elaborate and well-known highlights of the massive structure were installed under Emperor Jahangir- including the epic Picture Wall that’s
                 adorned with a colorful array of mosaics, tile, and frescoes.
                 The Sheesh Mahal- AKA the “Palace of Mirrors” was commissioned later under Shah Jahan. The immaculate marble room is inlaid with complex high-quality mirror work and is a must-visit when checking out the grounds.
                 The Lahore Fort- which spreads over 20+ hectares- can be found at the northern end of Lahore’s famous Walled City.

                   Lahore is chock-full of incredible pieces of history and it can easily have its own list. But as for this one, the beautiful Wazir Khan Mosque is a must- mention.
                   The mosque took its architectural queues from that from the Begum Shahi, and though the similarities are evident, the Wazir Khan is notably larger and more colorful.
                   The mosque was commissioned by Emperor Shah Jahan and stood completed by the year 1641. Incredibly intricate buon frescoes and elaborate tile work cover almost every square inch of it- you could really spend hours admiring it all!
                   The Wazir Khan Mosque can be found a few hundred meters after entering through the Delhi Gate in Lahore’s Walled City.

                 The Hiran Minar is one of the most popular historical places in Pakistan as far as visits are concerned. And though it is a tomb- this one is a bit different than others!
                 Most tombs in Punjab and across Pakistan house the remains of saints or royals but the Hiran Minar is dedicated not to Mughal Emperor Jahangir, but his pet antelope.
                 Yup you read that right- Emperor Jahangir was known for his love of nature and the Hiran Minar exemplifies that. It’s also set in a bit of a wilderness, which gave the Mughals a bit of a natural escape from the bustling city of Lahore.
                 The complex consists of a minaret built over the antelope along with a massive pool and accompanying pavilion.
                 And seeing that it’s only one hour from Lahore in Sheikhupura, the Hiran Minar is an easy day’s getaway.

                   You won’t have a complete list of historical places in Pakistan without including Mohenjo- Daro- one of the largest cities of the Indus Valley Civilization. The ancient city, which is a UNESCO World Heritage Site, was built around 2500 BCE and remained undocumented for over 3700 years until archeologists discovered it in the early 1920’s.
                   Mohenjo-Daro’s size (over 300 hectares) and inclusion of public buildings seem to represent a high level of social organization according to historians. Wild right? Though the ancient city is unknown by most people, it’s one of the most important landmarks in Asia.
                  You can find Mohenjo-Daro near the city of Larkana in Pakistan’s Sindh Province where it can then easily be reached by auto rickshaw.
                  Though unknown to most, this is truly one of the most incredible archeological sites in the world, and should be on every Pakistan itinerary.

                 On the outskirts of Lahore, you can find one of the most beautiful landmarks of Pakistan- the exquisite tomb of Mughal Emperor Jahangir. The tomb took 10 years to build and was finally finished in 1637.
                The walls of the tomb are decorated with inlaid marble, stunning floral frescoes, and is surrounded by lush gardens. Though the site has been damaged in floods throughout the years, it stands in good condition today despite being close to 400 years old.
                The tomb sits about 30-40 minutes outside of Lahore and is best reached by Careem or Uber if you don’t have your own vehicle.

                   Yes there are notable historical places in KPK too! Takht-i-Bhai is an archeological site of a Buddhist Monastery that can be found in Mardan. The site is considered to be exceptionally preserved and is a UNESCO World Heritage Site.
                   Takht-i-Bhai was founded in the 1st century CE and was abandoned by the 7th. If you’re interested in Pakistan’s ancient Buddhist history- this is the place to check out. The ruins contain a cluster of Stupas, monastic chambers, and even a Tantric monastic chamber.
                   The site sits at the top of a hill and can be easily accessed as a day trip from Mardan, Peshawar, or Islamabad.

                 Harappa was yet another city of the Indus Valley Civilization and was believed to be home to over 23,000 people. It’s worth noting that the Indus Valley Civilization is used interchangeably with the term Harappan Civilization, though it did include more than just the city of its namesake.
                 Though the settlement at one time spanned 150 hectares during the time period between 2600 BC and 1900 BC, it was badly damaged under British Rule of Pakistan and is now much smaller.
                 The present-day archeological site is located about 24 km from the Punjabi city of Sahiwal, and as it’s infrequently visited compared to some of the other historical places in Pakistan, it’s a great choice to visit for those looking for an alternative travel experience.

                   As you might have caught on by now- forts are easy to come by in Pakistan! But each and everyone has their own unique history and beauty, so brings us to the town of Kot Diji.
                   The Kot Diji Fort can be found upon a hill in Kot Diji, Sindh, and though it ain’t that old- what’s underneath it sure is! The fort was built between 1785-1795 by Mir Sohrab Khan Talpur, but it actually lies above the remains of a pre-historic civilization by the same name.
                   It’s believed that the remains date back as far as 3300 BCE, placing it before the Indus Valley/ Harappan Civilization. Yes- it’s real old!
                   Unlike some of the other forts mentioned on this list, Kot Diji is a bit more offbeat and as such attracts fewer tourists! Both the fort and the remains can be found about 24 km south of the city of Khairpur.

                 The Baltit Fort, which is located in Karimabad in the beautiful Hunza Valley, was founded in 8th CE and was inhabited by the Mirs of Hunza until 1945.
                 The fort, which takes its shape from Tibetan architecture, sits a-top a hill and lies claim to a marvelous view of the valley below.
                 The Baltit Fort has long been a popular tourist destination in Hunza and is very easy to visit- even on foot- within Karimabad.

                   So many historical sites in Pakistan happen to be ancient civilizations- and the lost city of Taxila is one of them! The origin of the city dates back to 1000 BCE, though some ruins at the site are thought to be as old as 3360 BCE. Woah!
                   Due to its strategic location just off the Grand Trunk Road, it changed hands many a time throughout its history.
                   Interestingly, the University of Ancient Taxila is considered to be one of the oldest in the world, though this is still disputed amongst scholars. In 1980, the entire city was designated as a UNESCO World Heritage Site.
                   There is also a museum near the ruins that charges an entry fee.
                   Due to its close proximity to Islamabad (32 km), Taxila has long been one of the most popular historical places in Pakistan and can be easily visited as a day trip from the capital.
                  <b>Visiting Hours:</b> Museum is open from 9AM-5PM, ruins are more flexible
                  <b>Entrance Fee:</b> Ruins are free, the museum costs 200 rupees for foreigners and 50 for Pakistanis
